It’s probably every month that I will start a new project, usually this coincides with me finding a new interesting technology.

Most of the time these technologies are in the alpha or beta phase, they’re new, unproven in the real world, but oh so cool to me.

So I start working with it, and at first it’s amazing.
I’m learning a bunch of stuff and I’m making good headway, as we all know the first 90% of a project takes 10% of the time, and the last 10% takes 90% of the time.
And then something happens, they change the API, or they stop working on the project, etc.

This was always a risk, I’m using pre production software right now. 
But a small setback like this can demotivate me so much.
And this got me thinking, should I stop using new technologies even if they inspire me?
