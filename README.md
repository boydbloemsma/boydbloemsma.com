# Boyd Bloemsma's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website and blog. I'm a developer who enjoys building things and juggling multiple side projects. This site serves as my digital home where I share what I'm working on and thinking about.

## Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication

This philosophy guides my approach to development. My website might look basic at first - clean design, minimal elements, and focused content. There's a purpose behind this approach: performance and usability come first. The site loads quickly everywhere and gets perfect PageSpeed scores, which matters to me as someone who values getting to information without waiting.

## Projects

Here are a couple of things I've built:

### Shelveless

A platform for book lovers to manage their lending library. Born from the challenge of keeping track of borrowed books, Shelveless helps you connect with friends and maintain a record of who's currently enjoying your favorite reads.

### localpantry.shop

A marketplace connecting local artisans with customers. This platform gives small-scale producers a simple way to showcase their creations and reach new audiences.

## Tech Stack

This website is built with:

- **Astro**: Fast, content-focused web framework
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling
- **Cloudflare**: For hosting and CDN

## Running Locally

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## Final Thought

The most elegant solutions often hide their complexity. What appears effortless on the surface usually represents hours of thoughtful work behind the scenes.
