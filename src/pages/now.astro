                    I have just launched my first project. <br />
                    Well, the first project I feel confident that will do well. <br />
                    It's a website where you can keep track of all your books, and to whom you have lend them. <br />
                    You can check it out <a href="https://shelveless.com" target="_blank">here</a>!

                    I still work at the EQOM Group.
                    Really enjoying talking to my 83yo friend bi-weekly.
                    Working on small side projects when time permits.
